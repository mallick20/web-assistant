# Academic Assistant

This project is designed to build an Academic Assistant using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The goal is to create a system that can act as a virtual assistant to manage various academic matters, summarizing and retrieving key information, aiding in academic tasks and helping with course related matters. By using NLP techniques, the assistant can provide accurate, context-driven answers based on course content and external data.

## Key Features
Automated Information Retrieval: The system can fetch relevant academic resources (e.g., articles, lecture notes, course materials, etc.) from a large repository of documents.

Question Answering: Users can ask the assistant academic-related questions, and the system will provide concise, contextually accurate answers.

Summarization: It generates summaries of academic papers, books, and articles, helping users quickly grasp the essential points of large texts.

Content Organization: The system categorizes and organizes study materials to make them easily accessible based on topics, relevance, or subjects.

Task Reminders: Integration with academic calendars to help manage deadlines for assignments, exams, and project submissions.
System Architecture

Document Retrieval: A retrieval module fetches relevant documents from the database based on user queries.
Text Generation: A generative model produces coherent, human-like responses by conditioning the output on the retrieved documents.

Link the system to academic calendars to help users track deadlines for projects, exams, and assignments.

Provide alerts and reminders based on priority and proximity to deadlines.


## Installation

Clone the repository to computer

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py


## Future Enhancements

Multimodal Input: Integrate additional data types such as images (e.g., charts, diagrams) for subjects like mathematics or science.

Improved Summarization: Enhance the summarization feature by allowing customization based on word limit or detail level.

By using this system, students can streamline their academic workflows, access information quickly, and maintain organization for successful learning outcomes.
